            of a person other than you without appropriate authorization. You
            shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your

            suspected loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your account or
            password. The Services will take reasonable security precautions
            when using the internet, telephone, or other means to transport data

          <p>
            You will indemnify and hold Axeite, its directors, officers, and
            employees, harmless, including costs and attorneys' fees, from any
            claim or demand made by any third party due to or arising out of
            your access to the Services, your violation of this Agreement, or
            the infringement by you, or any third party using your account, of
            any intellectual property or other rights of any person or entity.
          </p>

          <p>
            IN NO EVENT SHALL AXEITE, ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS,
            EMPLOYEES, OR MEMBERS BE LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES FOR (A)
            ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
            KIND WHATSOEVER; (B) DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF USE, PROFITS, DATA, IMAGES,
            USER CONTENT OR OTHER INTANGIBLES; (C) DAMAGES FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE,
            NON-PERFORMANCE OF THE SITE, ERRORS OR OMISSIONS; OR (D) DAMAGES

          <h2 className="font-bold text-xl">Termination</h2>
          <p>
            Either party may terminate the Services at any time by notifying the
            other party by any means. Axeite may also terminate or suspend any
            and all of the Services immediately, without prior notice or
            liability, if you breach any of the terms or conditions of this
            Agreement. Upon termination of your account, your right to use the
            Services, and access to any Content will immediately cease. All
            provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive
            termination shall survive termination, including, without
            limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and
            limitations of liability. Termination of your access to and use of
            the Services shall not relieve you of any obligations arising or
            accruing prior to such termination or limit any liability which you
            otherwise may have to Axeite or its Services, including without
            limitation any indemnification obligations contained herein.

          <h2 className="font-bold text-xl">Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            Please review our Privacy Policy, which governs the use of personal
            information in the Services and to which you agree to be bound as a
            user of the Services.
          </p>
          <h2 className="font-bold text-xl">Miscellaneous</h2>
          <p>
            This Agreement (including the Privacy Policy), as modified from time
            to time, constitutes the entire agreement between you, the Services,
            and Axeite with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement
            replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements,
            written or oral, regarding the subject matter hereof. The failure of
            either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for
            herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.
            Axeite shall not be liable for any failure to perform its
            obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause
            beyond Axeite reasonable control, including, without limitation,
            mechanical, electronic, or communications failure or degradation. If
            any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or
            invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the
            minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise
            remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is
            not assignable, transferable, or sublicensable by you except with
            Axeite prior written consent. Axeite may assign this Agreement in
            whole or in part at any time without your consent.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
            the United States laws without regard to the conflict of laws
            provisions thereof. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or
            employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you do not
            have any authority of any kind to bind Axeite in any respect
            whatsoever. Any notice to the Services that is required or permitted
            by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed effective
            upon receipt when sent by confirmed e-mail to me@axeite.com.
