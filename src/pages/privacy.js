            within our website and apps, your IP address, browser type, and

          <h2 className="font-bold font-xl">Cookie Data</h2>

            We use "cookies" and similar technologies to collect log data and
            operate our services. You can learn more about how we use cookies in
            "COOKIES" below.
          </p>
          <h2 className="font-bold font-xl">Device Data</h2>

          <h2 className="font-bold font-xl">Metadata of Visual Information</h2>
          <p>
            We collect the metadata linked to your content. For example, your
            images may be accompanied by additional content like a hashtag
            (e.g., to mark keywords), or comments. This makes your content more
            searchable by others and more interactive.
          </p>
          <p>
            All this information is only used to assist us in providing an
            effective service. We may, from time to time, supply the owners and
            operators of third-party websites and mobile applications which have
            a link to our site or application with information about the number
            of users of our Site or Mobile. You cannot be identified from any of
            this information.

          <h2 className="font-bold font-xl">Service Data </h2>
          <p>
            To use our Services, you should provide a photo prior to the event
            of photo editing. Since the processing requires an Internet
            connection and is performed on our servers the photos are sent there
            through the encrypted connection. We use Secure Socket Layer
            technology to protect the privacy and integrity of the transmission
            process.
          </p>
          <p>
            For non-registered users and users who don’t share their results
            within the Services, the original photos and results are
            automatically removed from our servers by two weeks after the last
            interaction. For registered users who share their results within the
            Services that provide special social network features, the shared
            content will be stored on the servers and shown within the Services
            unless a user either removes the images themselves or requests such
            removal by contacting our support team at me@gambit.com.
          </p>
          <p>
            The detected key points may be kept along with the photo on the
            servers of our providers for up to two weeks from the last
            interaction with the photo. The only purpose of this is to speed up
            any further processing of the same photos.
